# nix0

my nix configs

i have home manager but idk why i don't have home-manager installed
but running nix os rebuild or whatever actually rebuilds it as if home manager cli was there
but i always get `home-manager: command not found`

someone please tell me what's wrong with my config
maybe it's supposed to be like that?
